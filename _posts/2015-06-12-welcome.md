I've decided to start writing about things that I think
about daily. For almost 10 years, I've been thinking about
successfully implementing VM for Lua or Python.

Lua has more educational purpose in my life.
I have learned a lot from its simple implementation.

Python is language of choice for me. I like its elegance
and simplicity, but I hate its internal ecosystem. It is
huge. I wish we could install `subprocess` or `re` modules using
pip instead of they coming included inside python implementations.

This blog will be mainly about implementing Virtual Machines.
Practices might not be the best, but idea is to implement cool
stuff, so other can learn from it.

I will text with intermediate level of knowledge.
I expect that you understand compilation, basic VM principles, JIT compilation, etc.
