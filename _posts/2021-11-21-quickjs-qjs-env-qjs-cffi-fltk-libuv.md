I showcase how to set up a QuickJS environment and package manager. I demonstrate how to create automatic bindings for shared libraries like FLTK and libuv using QuickJS and Python. I also introduce qjs-env and qjs-cffi, tools that make the process of creating new QuickJS-based projects and installing requirements a breeze. Additionally, I show you how to use libuv to implement setTimeout and setInterval functions, which are not native to QuickJS.
