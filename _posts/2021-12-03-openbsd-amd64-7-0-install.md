I walk you through the process of installing OpenBSD 7.0 on an AMD Ryzen 5 1600x with an AMD VEGA 64. I guide you step-by-step, from setting up the BIOS to boot from a USB, to installing the operating system on a dedicated hard drive. I also demonstrate how to set up a graphical interface using xenodm and xfce4, and how to configure the PulseAudio sound system. Additionally, I show you how to set up a webcam for video conferencing in Firefox. This video is perfect for anyone interested in exploring the world of OpenBSD.
