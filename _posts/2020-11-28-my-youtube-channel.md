I started [YouTube channel][youtube] in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemics. It was perfect timing for me to finally align my thoughts. After years of thinking, I just started recording and publishing videos. My friends and colleagues asked me for years to record my talks and publish it for others to see. All opinions and advice are my own, and take them with grain of salt, I am just a regular guy doing interesting things online.

I cover broad topics from computer science and engineering. Including machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), Linux, BSD, data structures, algorithms, programming languages design and implementation, etc. Please check my [YouTube][youtube] channel and subscribe if you like topics that I cover. Feel free to leave comments and suggestions.
